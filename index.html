      <h4>1.Pulp Fiction</h4>
 <p>
    This movie is a Quentin Tarantino masterpiece which displays violence and gore such that the story is divided into subplots of the movie<br />
    and are connected or intertwined again in a natural manner which makes it watchable many times and still expect a thrill.
 </p>
 <h4>2.Breaking bad</h4>
 <p> An amazing thrilling series which is made to keep the viewers interested and indulged throughout the entire series.<br/>
    Story depicts the life and decision making of a proficient chemist who has been diagnosed with cancer but has to make<br />
    enough money to provide for his family but pursues a rather criminal way which makes up for many of the twists in the series.
</p>
<h4>3.The Departed</h4>
<p>
    Although I can't remember the specifics of the movie, I still remember being engrossed with the storyline and also<br />
    remarkable cast selection which makes it an unforgettable movie. The police department is adamant to pursue a criminal mob boss<br />
    but they have an agent go undercover to be a part of his gang, but at the same time the criminal boss has a mole in the police department<br />
    and these 2 individuals try and expose one another.
